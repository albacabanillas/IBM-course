# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized

# **Objectives:**
# - List some languages or libraries for Data Science
# - Insert and delete cells in Jupyter Notebooks
# - Insert table
# - Use some arithmetic expressions for Python

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:  
# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. SQL

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientist include: 
# 1. TensorFlow
# 2. Pandas
# 3. SciKit-Learn
# 4. Pytorch

# | Apache Spark                   |
# | Tensor Flow    

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[4]:


a = 1
b = 2
 
c = a + b
d = a * b
f = d/2

print (c)
print (d)
print (f)


# In[5]:


#Exercise 8

#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
result= (3*4)+5
print (result)


# In[7]:


#Excercise 9

#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
min = 200
hours = 200 / 60
print (hours)
